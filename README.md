## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned
This project helped me refresh my knowledge in using grids. I was also going about the wrong way to make the colored borders which was making my code complex and filled with issues. I later found out that I could have just used the `border-top`CSS property to make them.

### Continued development

I wish to further remake this webpage using Bootstrap to refresh my knowledge in the same.


### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow questions regarding divs disappearing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21534454/div-disappears-when-height-is-a-percentage-or-auto) - This helped me in understanding how putting the value as absolute takes the div away from the flow of the document hence making it overlap and/or disappear under certain instances.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This is an amazing documentation that gave me a lot of insight on how to use certain class names to make the work easier.
